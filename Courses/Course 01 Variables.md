- Average Reading Time: ~6 Minutes

A variable is essentially a name attached to a value. There are three baseline ways to define a variable, which is what this course will be explaining.

**Note:** Before we get into scripting, to see the output messages caused by `print`, you will need to go into the "VIEW" tab in Roblox Studio (located around the top left) and then click on the "Output" button to enable the output.

## Word Contexts
- **Values** are [strings](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/strings) ("A String"), [numbers](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/numbers) (1234), [booleans](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/booleans) (true/false), [data types](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes) and more.
- **Scopes** are defined [here](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/scope).
- **Define** (in programming) means to create a variable.

## 1. Local Variables
A local variable is a variable that can only be accessed in the [scope](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/scope) it was defined in.
<br>It is most common and best to use local variables instead of global and shared variables whenever possible, as they are faster and take up less memory.
### Creation
First, let's begin constructing a local variable. We'll start with the `local` keyword.
```lua
local
```
Next, we will need to give our local variable a name. Let's do `MyFirstVariable` in this example.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable
```
Let's make sure we know what names are appropriate for variables, and what names arent.
```lua
-- Note: Using two hyphens (--) before text will create a comment, which will not be seen when the code is running.
local MyFirstVariable -- Good ‚úÖ
local _MyFirstVariable -- Good ‚úÖ
local 1MyFirstVariable -- Bad ‚ùå, can't have numbers at the start of a variable name.
local üî•MyFirstVariable -- Bad ‚ùå, can't have non-UTF8 characters in a variable name.
local MyFirstVariable1234 -- Good ‚úÖ
local if -- Bad ‚ùå, can't have a variable name be a syntax keyword.
-- Note: The easiest way to tell if a word is a keyword is by seeing if their color differs from other variable names.
```
Note: Variable names are case sensitive, and as such, if you create a variable name with `MyFirstVariable`, but access it with `myfirstvariable`, it will give you a different variable's value, or `nil` if one wasn't defined with that name.

Now that we have a general idea of what variable names are good, and which are bad, let's continue with the course.
<br>To begin assigning a value, we'll need to use the `=` sign.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable =
```
Now, we'll need to assign it a value. We'll use the string "Hello, world!" in this example.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
```
And there we have it‚Äîour first variable. Let's print it to see what we get from it.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
```
We have now created and used our first variable. Let's try to change it's value now.
We can do this by simply using the variable name, the `=` sign, then the new value like how we did when we defined them.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
print(MyFirstVariable)  -- Outputs: Hello, world!

MyFirstVariable = "Goodbye, world!"
print(MyFirstVariable)  -- Outputs: Goodbye, world!
```
You should note that setting a local variable's value like this will not turn it into a global, unless you set it outside of the scope, which would count as defining it.
<br>Also, if you place a `local` before changing the variable, it will count as re-defining the variable, so it sometimes may give the same results, but it won't be the same thing.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Hello, world!

MyFirstVariable = "Goodbye, world!" -- Good ‚úÖ
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Goodbye, world!

local MyFirstVariable = "Goodbye, world!" -- Bad ‚ùå
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Goodbye, world!
```
Now that we understand local variables a bit more, let's get started with understanding how local variables act under different scopes.
### Scopes
First up, we'll create a [scope](https://create.roblox.com/docs/luau/scope) by using `do end`
```lua
do

end
```
Now that we have a new scope, let's use our previously created local variable inside it.
```lua
do
¬† ¬† local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
end
```
Once that's done, we'll next print the value to ensure it gives us what we want.
```lua
do
¬† ¬† local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
¬† ¬† print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
end
```
Now that we know that our code works, let's place a print outside the scope to show the effect of a local variable in a different scope.
```lua
do
¬† ¬† local MyFirstVariable = "Hello, world!"
¬† ¬† print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
end
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: nil
```
As you can see, when a variable is accessed outside the scope it was defined in, it will have no value, which is why it's `nil`.
<br>The easiest way to know where a variable is located in a scope is to look at where endings are placed, such as `end` or `until`; any code past any `end` will most likely be outside that given scope.

A feature of all variables, not just local, is being able to define multiple variables at once using commas.
```lua
local MyFirstVariable, MySecondVariable = "Hello, world!", "This is the second variable!"
```
If we use these and print them both out, we can see the values we assigned to them.
```lua
-- Note that these variables are assigned separately but are just done at once.
local MyFirstVariable, MySecondVariable = "Hello, world!", "This is the second variable!"
print(MyFirstVariable) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
print(MySecondVariable) -- Outputs: This is the second variable!
```
You should now be able to understand more about variables and local variables.
That will conclude the explanation of local variables. Now we are moving on to the second way to define a variable.
## 2. Global Variables
A global variable, unlike local variables, can be accessed outside of scopes.
To make a global variable, you can simply follow the steps of a local variable, but without adding the `local` keyword before the name, for example:
```lua
MyFirstGlobal = "Hello, world!"
print(MyFirstGlobal) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
```
Now that you've made a global variable, let's try putting it inside a different scope, like we did with the local variables.
```lua
do
¬† ¬† MyFirstGlobal = "Hello, world!"
¬† ¬† print(MyFirstGlobal) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
end
print(MyFirstGlobal) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
```
We have now successfully learned global variables; we will move on to our third and final explanation.
## 3. Shared Variables
A shared variable is closest to the global variables, but you will be able to access them across two different scripts.
<br>There are two ways to access and create a shared variable: using `_G` and using `shared`. I will be showing you the first method, but if you'd like to try to use the second, you can simply replace all `_G` usage in the code with `shared`.

Let's create our first shared variable. We'll need two scripts to test this one properly, so make sure you're prepared.

In our first script, we're going to want to use this code:
```lua
_G.MyFirstShared = "Hello, world!"
```
In our second script, we're going to want to use this code:
```lua
print(_G.MyFirstShared)
```
We have now created a shared variable in one script and used it in another.
<br>Congratulations on your first step into scripting! Here's a final task to ensure you can remember this information:
## Learning Task
Here are steps to create your own variable:
1. Create and open a script in Roblox Studio.
2. Create a `local` variable with the name of your choice.
3. Assign the variable you created's value to a string of your favorite word, such as "Pizza". Don't forget to use quotation marks (`"`) to ensure it is a string.
4. Use the `print` function like in the code examples, replacing `MyFirstVariable` with the name you gave the variable, then see if it prints in the output.
5. If it has been printed, you have completed this course and are ready to move on to the next. If it didn't print correctly, had an error, or didn't run, you may want to read this course again.

Thank you for reading this course, and good luck on your scripting journey.
