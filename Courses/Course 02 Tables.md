Tables are essentially a value that allows you to store other values, similar to how variables are. This course will teach you how to construct & utilize tables.

## Word Contexts
- **Indices**: Plural of index.
- **Indexing**: To get a value of an index from a table.

## 1. Arrays
An array is a table that has numbered indices, such as 1, 2, 3, 4, etc.
<br>We will start by constructing an empty table inside a variable
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {}
```
Once we've done that, we will give it an index, first we'll start with `1` to ensure it's an array.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    -- [Index] = Value
    [1] = "Hello, world!"
}
```
The reason why we surround the index with brackets (`[]`) is because it's a number, only names that qualify as variables can be used for an index's name without brackets.
<br>Next, we'll want to retrieve the value of the first index from our array.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!"
}

local FirstIndexValue = MyFirstTable[1]
```
Now that we have the value of the first index, let's print it out.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!"
}

local FirstIndexValue = MyFirstTable[1]
print(FirstIndexValue) -- Outputs: Hello, world!
```
Now that we know how to access the value, let's change it.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!"
}

MyFirstTable[1] = "New value!"
local FirstIndexValue = MyFirstTable[1]
print(FirstIndexValue) -- Outputs: New value!
```
A common mistake between manipulating a table's value is changing a variable that contains the table's value, here's an example on what not to do.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!"
}

MyFirstTable[1] = "New value!" -- Good ‚úÖ

local FirstIndexValue = MyFirstTable[1]
FirstIndexValue = "New value!" -- Bad ‚ùå: This will only change our FirstIndexValue variable, not the actual index inside the MyFirstTable.
```
Now that we're knowledgable on how to properly change values, let's add a second index.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!",
    [2] = "Goodbye, world!"
}

local FirstIndexValue = MyFirstTable[1]
print(FirstIndexValue) -- Outputs: Hello, world!

local SecondIndexValue = MyFirstTable[2]
print(SecondIndexValue) -- Goodbye, world!
```
As you can see, before adding the second index, a comma was placed after the first index's value, this is how we seperate the indexes. Forgetting to add a comma is a common mistake, so ensure you don't forget.
<br>Arrays require the indices to be ordered, so there can't be gaps like this:
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!",
    [3] = "Goodbye, world!" -- Skipped the number 2.
}
```
This makes the third index no longer valid, and therefore not part of the array. This will make the array appear as if there is only one index when used in practice, but you will still be able to get the value from the third index when indexing the table.
<br>Now that we know the essentials of arrays, let's move onto dictionaries.
## 2. Dictionaries
A dictionary is a table that has string based indices, unlike arrays.
<br>Let's first make an index in an empty table, we'll use the string `"Apple"`.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    ["Apple"] = "An apple!"
}
```
Now, let's retrieve the value from the dictionary.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    ["Apple"] = "An apple!"
}

local Apple = MyFirstTable["Apple"]
```
Now that we have the value, let's print it out.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    ["Apple"] = "An apple!"
}

local Apple = MyFirstTable["Apple"]
print(Apple) -- Outputs: An apple!
```
Now that we see the difference between arrays and dictionaries, let's look at other ways to use indexes.
<br>First, we'll see another way to write out an index for dictionaries. You wont need to use quotes to make it a string or brackets to know it's an index.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    Apple = "An apple!"
}
```
Now that we know this, let's make sure we know what indexes work and how we can use those that don't.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    Apple = "An apple!", -- Good ‚úÖ
    ["Apple"] = "An apple!", -- Good ‚úÖ
    Apple Fruit = "An apple!", -- Bad ‚ùå: You can't have whitespaces in a index name without using a string and brackets.
    ["Apple Fruit"] = "An apple!", -- Good ‚úÖ
    üçé = "An apple!", -- Bad ‚ùå: You can't use non-UTF8 characters in an index name without using a string and brackets.
    ["üçé"] = "An apple!" -- Good ‚úÖ
}
```
Now that we know what we can make our indexes with, let's see other ways to access their values.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    Apple = "An apple!"
}

local Apple = MyFirstTable.Apple
```
Using a dot (`.`) we are able to access the value of the `Apple` index.
<br>One thing about using a dot though, is that it cannot access indexes that wouldn't qualify as a variable name. This is where the use of gaining an index's value through a string with brackets comes in.
<br>Let's see the valid ways to access certain indexes.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    Apple = "An apple!",
    ["Apple Fruit"] = "An apple!",
    ["üçé"] = "An apple!"
}

local Apple = MyFirstTable.Apple -- Good ‚úÖ
local Apple = MyFirstTable["Apple"] -- Good ‚úÖ

local AppleFruit = MyFirstTable.Apple Fruit -- Bad ‚ùå: This is a case where we have to use a string in brackets.
local AppleFruit = MyFirstTable["Apple Fruit"] -- Good ‚úÖ

local AppleEmoji = MyFirstTable.üçé -- Bad ‚ùå: This is a case where we have to use a string in brackets.
local AppleEmoji = MyFirstTable["üçé"] -- Good ‚úÖ
```
Now that we can confidently use tables, let's see what Mixed Tables are.
## 3. Mixed
Mixed Tables are, as you could guess, a mix between arrays and dictionaries. It will have both numbered indices in a proper order, while also having string-based indices.
<br>Here's an example on what a mixed table could look like.
```lua
local MyFirstTable = {
    [1] = "Hello, world!",
    [2] = "Goodbye, world!",
    Apple = "An apple!"
}
```
<br>That will conclude the explanations of our course, make sure to do the learning task to ensure you process and understand this infomation.
## Learning Task
Here are the steps to create an array:
1. Create and open a script in Roblox Studio.
2. Create a (local) variable.
3. Make the variable's value start with an opening curly brace (`{`)
4. Add an ending curly brace (`}`)
5. Within the two curly braces, add the index `1` while using brackets. Should appear as `[1]`.
6. Using an `=` sign, make the first index's value be a string such as "pizza."
7. Indexing the table, print out the first index's value.
8. If it has printed, you have completed this course and are ready to move on to the next. If it didn't print correctly, had an error, or didn't run, try reading this course again.
